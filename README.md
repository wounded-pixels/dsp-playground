## Switch to canvas
* pass size
* responsive resize?

## Today
* pretty up 
  * spacing
  * background
  * top branding
* router and navigation
* top pane and branding
* can whole widget be resized? Expandable div with scaling? some way to let them flow naturally from reading to shallow play to immersive play?
* Zen mode?

## Navigation and Chunking
* start page should be sticky - maybe the add sines?
  * Just start in the middle with fun stuff!
* No classic site map nav bar!
* simple Top Nav:
  * site and app branding on left 
  * Topics on right - 10,000 foot view of topics in context - like a wiki
  * About on right - who, what wp, what dsp-playground, why
* each page should link to other pages with useful content / context
* help hovers as needed but don't let it get junky
* each page should have a logical Next link to go further

## Topics
* Adding sines
* Adding sines with frequency controls - (freq domain and time domain)
* Terminology for freq and time domains
* Sines, Cosines and the Unit Circle
* From angles to time
* 




## Soonish
* eda should allow no y label and use the space
* gh pages deployment
* Move equation into chart? or independent?
* tie equation to inputs
  
## Someday
* graphic to tie unit circle to strip chart
  * slider to increase angle 
  * triangle and dot on unit circle
  * sin curve along angle with dot
  * dotted and solid lines
  * maybe same for cos?
